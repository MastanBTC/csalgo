<h1>A hearty Welcome! </h1>

<p>I am a Software Development Engineer at Adobe Systems Noida. I have been associated with the IT industry for over 3 years now. Prior to Adobe, I had wonderful experiences serving Amazon Gurgaon and @walmartLabs Bangalore. </p>

<p>I spent my most beautiful and crucial phase of life at IISC Bangalore. I pursued my M.E. from Computer Science and Automation Department @IISC. I did my thesis in the domain of Programming Analysis and Verification (with Dr. Deepak desouza). Also worked closely in the software engineering field as part of my undergraduate project in JIIT Noida.</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I am interested in learning different dance forms. Have also participated in multiple dance performances in my student life. Given a chance, would like to pursue a degree in some classical dance form like kathak or bharatnatyam. I enjoy organising different events and outings both at my workplace and personally.</p>
